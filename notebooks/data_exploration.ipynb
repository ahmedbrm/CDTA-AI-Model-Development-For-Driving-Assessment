    "- Understand the overall structure and size of the dataset  \n",
    "- Identify attribute types and key features  \n",
    "- Assess data quality issues such as missing, inconsistent, or extreme values  \n",
    "- Generate descriptive statistics for numerical and categorical attributes  \n",
    "- Visualize data distributions and basic relationships between variables  \n",
    "- Document initial observations to inform later preprocessing and data mining tasks  \n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, no data cleaning, transformation, or mining techniques are applied. The goal is solely to **understand the data** and prepare for subsequent analysis.\n"
