    "This notebook focuses on the **data preprocessing phase** . The main objectives of this stage are to prepare the raw data for effective data mining by improving its quality and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The preprocessing steps include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handling missing values and inconsistent records  \n",
    "- Removing duplicates and correcting invalid entries  \n",
    "- Encoding categorical attributes where required  \n",
    "- Normalizing or discretizing numerical features  \n",
    "- Selecting relevant attributes for mining tasks  \n",
    "- Transforming the dataset into analysis-ready formats  \n",
    "\n",
    "All preprocessing decisions are guided by insights obtained during the data exploration phase. The output of this notebook is a **cleaned and well-structured dataset** that will be used for classification, clustering, and association rule analysis.\n"
